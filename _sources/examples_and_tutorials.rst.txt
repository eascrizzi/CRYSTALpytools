Examples and Tutorials
======================

Each function is documented in Jupyter Notebooks that can be found in the `example folder <https://github.com/crystal-code-tools/CRYSTALpytools/tree/main/examples>`_. There is one notebook per function file (e.g. the functions contained in 'crystal_io.py' are explained in the 'examples/crystal_io.ipynb' notebook).

Tutorials can be found in the `tutorial folder <https://github.com/crystal-code-tools/CRYSTALpytools/tree/main/tutorial>`_.
