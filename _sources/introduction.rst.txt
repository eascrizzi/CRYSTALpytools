Introduction
============

The CRYSTALpytools python package contains functions that allow the user to access the `CRYSTAL code <https://www.crystal.unito.it/index.html>`_ input, output and execution from a python infrastructure, such as Jupyter Notebooks. Although they can achieve this goal on their own, they achieve their full potential when used together with `PyMatGen <https://pymatgen.org/index.html>`_. In this latter scenario, the CRYSTALpytools could be seen as a layer between CRYSTAL and pymatgen.

In January 2022 the first stable version (v2022.1.10) was released. The latest release is available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/CRYSTALpytools/>`_ and can be installed via ``pip`` (See the next section).
